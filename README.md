# kafka-workshop

## Installation Options:

Take a look at install directory for installation options. 

### Easy setup
* (recommended) Use docker-compose for a quick and easy single-node-broker setup
    * The above will provide access to kafka broker via `localhost:9093` from local machine.
* Use local-install only if docker is unavailable in dev environment  

* Don't worry about Kubernetes for now. It'll be covered during demos.
