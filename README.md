# kafka-workshop

## Installation Options:

Take a look at install directory for installation options. 

### Easy local setup (recommended)
* Use docker-compose for a quick and easy single-node-broker setup
    * The above will provide access to kafka broker via `localhost:9093` from local machine.
    * see `docker-compose` inside `install` directoy.

* Optionally, install `kafka` locally, so you can use its Command-Line Interface. 
    * See `local` directory inside `install` folder
    * If you don't have `docker`, then you'll also have the option to run kafka server directly.

Don't worry about Kubernetes for now. It is mainly for live demo.
